PART-3 STEPS

## Setting Up the Project
Initialized the project with `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`.
Created a structured project folder, including an `images` directory for assets.

## Building the HTML
Created semantic HTML structure with sections for the header, search/date input, main content, and favorites list.
Used proper class names for easier CSS targeting.

## Styling with CSS
Designed the site according to the PDF mockup using custom CSS with modern layout techniques (Flexbox, CSS Grid).
Applied gradients, background colors, shadows, and responsive design with media queries to ensure usability on mobile and desktop.
Made use of consistent font, color, and spacing to match the high-fidelity design.

## Challenges Faced

**Matching Mockup Details**
